# pentomino-solver

## About the Project

I got a wood block puzzle, but lost interest before I could solve it.
Rather than give up, I wrote this program to solve it for me.

### Built With

This project uses multiple c++ standard libraries.
No other external libraries are used.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this program, you will need a c++ compiler.

### Installation

To install, download all code and header files from this repo into the same folder.
Then, use your chosen compiler to compile with `pentomino_solver.cpp` as the primary file.

## Usage

To use, run your created executable in the command line.
If you would like the solutions to be printed to a file, include the name of the file as a command line argument (this option is recommended).
You should see periodic statements printed out to indicate progress.
Upon completion, a list of all possible solutions should be printed.
